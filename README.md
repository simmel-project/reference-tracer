# Simmel Reference Tracer

Simmel is designed to be easily adaptable to any contact tracing
implementation. This project represents a reference implementation of one
possible contact tracing system.

It is based on Singapore's TraceTogether project.

## Software Support

This relies on Circuit Python for NRF boards, such as [Circuit Python for Simmel](https://circuitpython.org/board/simmel/). Ensure you have this installed on your device, then copy `code.py` over to it. You can use the USB terminal to interact with it or to monitor tracing.

## About the Simmel Project

The Simmel project was started on April 10, 2020 in response to a request for a hardware design proposal by NLNet. The Simmel project name comes from Georg Simmel, an early researcher into sociology and social distance theory.

The Simmel team is funded through the [NGI0 PET
Fund](https://nlnet.nl/PET), a fund established by NLnet with financial
support from the European Commission's [Next Generation
Internet](https://ngi.eu/) programme, under the aegis of DG
Communications Networks, Content and Technology under grant agreement No
